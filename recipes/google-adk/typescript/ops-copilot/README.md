# Build a Google ADK Agent with the ArmorIQ SDK

A step-by-step guide to building an AI agent on Google's Agent Development Kit that can look up customers, read support tickets, and issue refunds, with every action checked against your organization's policy before it runs.

***

## What you'll build

An internal ops copilot, the agent version of a SaaS company's admin panel. A support engineer asks it to resolve a billing complaint, and it works through the ticket:

```
Read support ticket TKT-4471 → look up the customer → list their charges
→ refund the duplicate $49 charge          → ALLOWED
→ apply a $2,388 goodwill credit           → HELD for a human to approve
→ export the customer table (the ticket    → BLOCKED
   asked it to)
```

Google's [Agent Development Kit](https://github.com/google/adk-js) runs the agent loop for you: it sends the conversation to Gemini, collects the tool calls the model wants to make, executes them, feeds the results back, and repeats until the model is finished. ADK exposes lifecycle callbacks at exactly the points ArmorIQ needs, so you install ArmorIQ onto the agent in one line instead of hand-rolling a plan → check → execute → report loop yourself.

That last step above is the interesting one. The ticket contains a prompt injection, the model falls for it, and ArmorIQ refuses the call anyway, because the decision was never the model's to make.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: final terminal output of a complete run, showing ALLOWED, HELD and BLOCKED in sequence. -->

## Try it offline first

Want to see all three outcomes before you deploy anything? Offline mode runs the real ADK agent (`src/index.ts` and `src/ask.ts`) with local stand-ins for Gemini, the ops MCP server, and ArmorIQ (in `offline/`), so it needs no keys and no network:

```bash
npm install
npm run demo:offline                              # allowed, held then approved, and blocked
OFFLINE_APPROVAL=reject npm run demo:offline      # the approver says no this time
npm run test:offline                              # both runs, as a pass or fail check
```

The stand-in model replays the run in Step 12, including falling for the injected export, and the offline policy is the one from Step 9.

## The four ideas you need

Every step below uses these four words. Knowing them up front makes the rest of the guide easier to follow.

| Word             | What it means                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Plan**         | The list of tool calls the model decided to make, captured right after it decides, before any of them run.                                                                     |
| **Intent token** | A cryptographic receipt of that plan. Signed once, then checked before every tool call to prove the call was actually part of it.                                              |
| **Scope**        | One run, for one user. Created with `armoriq.forUser(userEmail, ...)`. Policy is looked up per user, so the same tool call can be allowed for one person and held for another. |
| **Invoke**       | The moment a tool actually runs. This is where enforcement happens: ArmorIQ checks the call against the plan and the policy *before* the tool executes, not after.             |

How they fit together:

```
 agent decides on tool calls
          │
          ▼
   plan captured, signed  ───►  intent token
          │
          ▼
   agent tries to invoke a tool
          │
          ▼
   ArmorIQ checks: is this call in the plan? does policy allow it?
          │
   ┌──────┼──────┐
   ▼      ▼      ▼
 ALLOW   HOLD   BLOCK
 (runs) (waits  (never
         for a   runs)
         human)
```

The important part: this check happens *outside* the model, in your code, before the tool runs. A prompt injection can persuade the model to want something; it can never make ArmorIQ allow it.

## Before you start

You'll need:

| Requirement                                         | Why                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js v20 or later, and npm                       | Runs the agent                                       |
| An ArmorIQ account                                  | Policy enforcement and observability                 |
| A Gemini API key                                    | ADK is Gemini-native; the model plans the tool calls |
| The `armoriq-adk-ops-mcp` repo, cloned and deployed | The agent's tools. Step 2 walks you through it       |

Check your Node version before starting:

```bash
node --version   # v20.0.0 or higher
npm --version    # v10.0.0 or higher
```

***

## Step 1: Create your ArmorIQ account and API key

1. Go to [platform.armoriq.ai](https://platform.armoriq.ai) and sign up, or log in if you already have an account.
2. Open **Settings → API Keys**.
3. Click **Generate new key**, and copy it somewhere safe. You won't be able to see it again.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: the API Keys screen with the "Generate new key" button. -->

Keys start with `ak_live_` or `ak_test_`. The SDK validates that prefix when it starts up, so a malformed key fails immediately rather than mysteriously.

## Step 2: Deploy the MCP server

Your agent's tools come from an MCP server. Clone the one this guide is built around. It already has the sixteen tools, four risk tiers, and demo data this walkthrough uses:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fuzailkazi/armoriq-adk-ops-mcp
cd armoriq-adk-ops-mcp
npm install
```

It's an ordinary Express app with a `render.yaml` and a `Dockerfile`. Deploy it. ArmorIQ needs to reach it directly, so it has to be at a **public HTTPS URL**; `localhost` won't work once you're running against the real platform.

```bash
# Render: New > Blueprint, point it at the repo. Or:
gcloud run deploy ops-mcp --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
```

Note the URL it gives you. **The MCP endpoint is that URL with** `/mcp` **on the end**, for example `https://ops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`.

Confirm it's serving tools before you go further:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://ops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

You should get sixteen tools back, grouped into four risk tiers: reads, low-risk writes, money, and destructive. That grouping is what your policy will act on in Step 6.

> **Building your own MCP instead?** Put **no permission logic in it.** Your MCP server doesn't know who is asking; the agent layer does.

## Step 3: Get a Gemini API key

1. Go to [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Click **Create API key** and copy it.

> **Careful with the variable name.** Google's SDK reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY`, **not** `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, which is the one most people reach for first. Get this wrong and the agent runs, calls nothing, and returns nothing.

## Step 4: Register the MCP server with ArmorIQ

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the standard your agent uses to call tools through one consistent interface. Before policy can reference those tools, ArmorIQ needs to know the server exists.

1. In the ArmorIQ console, open **MCP Servers**.
2. Click **Register MCP Server**.
3. Name it `ops-mcp`. This guide's code assumes that name.
4. Paste the URL from Step 2, including `/mcp`.
5. Save.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: the MCP registration form, filled in. -->

The name is the identifier your code and your policies both use. **It must match exactly.** A mismatch doesn't error; it just silently means no policy applies.

## Step 5: Register your agent

1. Open **Agents → Register Agent**.
2. Name it `ops-copilot`.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: the agent registration screen. -->

Policy is attributed by agent name. If your code sends `ops-copilot` and the console has something else, your policies won't fire and nothing will tell you why. This is the most common setup mistake, and Step 9 includes a check that catches it.

## Step 6: Write your policies

Four policies, one per risk tier. Start with the permissive one, confirm it works, then add the rest. Debugging one policy is much easier than debugging four.

1. Open **Policies → New Policy**.
2. Create each of these, scoped to the `ops-mcp` MCP:

| Policy                          | Action                          | Tools                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `reads-allowed`                 | **allow**                       | `lookup_customer`, `get_subscription`, `get_invoices`, `get_ticket`, `list_tickets`, `add_account_note`, `reply_to_ticket`, `extend_trial` |
| `money-needs-approval`          | **hold** above the user's limit | `issue_refund`, `apply_discount`                                                                                                           |
| `account-changes-need-approval` | **hold**                        | `change_plan`, `suspend_account`                                                                                                           |
| `destructive-ops-denied`        | **block**                       | `export_all_customers`, `impersonate_user`, `grant_admin_role`, `delete_account`                                                           |

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: the policy editor showing the money threshold rule. -->

3. Then give two users different refund limits: a tier-1 agent at `$500` and a manager at `$10,000`. That difference is what produces the **held** step in the demo.

<!-- 📸 Screenshot placeholder: the users screen with two different refund limits. -->

Two things worth getting right here:

**Cover both money tools.** If `money-needs-approval` names only `issue_refund`, the model will reach for `apply_discount` instead, not to evade anything, just because it fits the request better. We watched Gemini do exactly that.

**ArmorIQ fails closed.** Until a policy matches, every call is refused with `no_matching_policy`. A half-configured account looks identical to a very strict one.

***

## Step 7: Scaffold the project

```bash
mkdir ops-copilot-agent
cd ops-copilot-agent
npm init -y
```

Open `package.json` and set `"type": "module"`, plus a start script:

```json
{
  "name": "ops-copilot-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "ask": "tsx src/index.ts",
    "check": "tsx src/check-setup.ts"
  }
}
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @google/adk @armoriq/sdk @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dotenv tsx
npm install -D typescript @types/node
```

| Package                     | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@google/adk`               | The agent loop: model calls, tool execution, lifecycle callbacks                                           |
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | The MCP client `MCPToolset` loads. ADK declares it as an optional peer, so npm will not pull it in for you |
| `@armoriq/sdk`              | Plan capture, policy checks, audit trail                                                                   |
| `dotenv`                    | Loads your `.env` file                                                                                     |
| `tsx`                       | Runs TypeScript directly, no build step                                                                    |

> **`tsx` belongs in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`.** You need it at start-up. In dev dependencies, any `npm install --omit=dev`, which is what Render, Docker and Cloud Run all do, produces a deploy with no `tsx` that cannot boot.

Create `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    // "bundler" lets us import @armoriq/sdk/dist/... The SDK is CommonJS and
    // publishes no "exports" map, so the deep path is how you reach the
    // integration.
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "types": ["node"]
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*.ts"]
}
```

`"moduleResolution": "bundler"` is not optional. `@armoriq/sdk` is CommonJS and publishes no `exports` map, so the ADK integration can only be imported by its real on-disk path, and `bundler` is what makes that resolve.

Create the file structure:

```bash
mkdir src
touch .env src/config.ts src/error-message.ts src/ask.ts src/index.ts src/check-setup.ts
```

`error-message.ts` is one small helper, used everywhere you catch an error:

```typescript
// src/error-message.ts
//
// A `catch` block in TypeScript receives `unknown`, not `Error`. The thrown
// value could be anything. This is the one place that decides how to read it.
export function errorMessage(error: unknown): string {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    return error.message;
  }
  return String(error);
}
```

## Step 8: Configure environment variables

```bash
# .env

# From platform.armoriq.ai → Settings → API Keys
ARMORIQ_API_KEY=ak_live_your_key_here

# From aistudio.google.com/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here

# Must match exactly what you registered in Steps 4 and 5
ARMORIQ_AGENT_NAME=ops-copilot
ARMORIQ_MCP_NAME=ops-mcp

# Your MCP server from Step 2, including /mcp
MCP_URL=https://ops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
```

Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately, before you forget:

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

Then read it in one place, `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
// src/config.ts
import 'dotenv/config';

function required(name: string): string {
  const value = process.env[name];
  if (!value) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${name}. See .env.example.`);
  }
  return value;
}

/**
 * Where the MCP server is running.
 *
 * The MCP server is a separate repo and a separate deployment, so set MCP_URL
 * to its public URL with /mcp on the end:
 *
 *   MCP_URL=https://ops-mcp.onrender.com/mcp
 *
 * MCP_HOST is a convenience: if you happen to run both services in the same
 * Render workspace you can point it at the MCP service and we build the URL
 * from it. MCP_URL always wins.
 */
function resolveMcpUrl(): string {
  if (process.env.MCP_URL) {
    return process.env.MCP_URL;
  }
  if (process.env.MCP_HOST) {
    return `https://${process.env.MCP_HOST}/mcp`;
  }
  return 'http://localhost:8788/mcp';
}

export const config = {
  /** Your ArmorIQ API key. Starts with ak_live_ or ak_test_. */
  armoriqApiKey: required('ARMORIQ_API_KEY'),

  /** The agent name you registered on platform.armoriq.ai. */
  agentName: process.env.ARMORIQ_AGENT_NAME ?? 'ops-copilot',

  /** The MCP name you registered on platform.armoriq.ai. Must match exactly. */
  mcpName: process.env.ARMORIQ_MCP_NAME ?? 'ops-mcp',

  mcpUrl: resolveMcpUrl(),

  /** Which Gemini model to use. */
  model: process.env.GEMINI_MODEL ?? 'gemini-2.5-flash',

  /**
   * How long to wait for a human to approve a held action, in seconds.
   *
   * The SDK's default is 300. We use 60 because waiting five minutes for a
   * click is painful. If nobody approves in time, the action is refused.
   * ArmorIQ fails closed.
   */
  approvalWaitSeconds: Number(process.env.APPROVAL_WAIT_SECONDS ?? 60),

  /** Set to "1" to run with no enforcement at all, to see the difference. */
  disableArmoriq: process.env.DISABLE_ARMORIQ === '1',
};
```

## Step 9: Check your setup before writing the agent

Two mistakes, a wrong agent name and a wrong MCP name, produce identical, silent failures. Catch them first, along with a third: an MCP server that isn't actually reachable yet.

```typescript
// src/check-setup.ts
//
//   npm run check
//
// This only reads. It does not create plans, tokens, or approval requests, so
// it is safe to run against a real account.
import { ArmorIQClient } from '@armoriq/sdk';
import { config } from './config.js';
import { errorMessage } from './error-message.js';

type NamedEntry = { name?: string };

/** Turns [{name:"a"},{name:"b"}] into ["a","b"]. Unnamed entries become "?". */
function namesOf(entries: NamedEntry[] | undefined): string[] {
  if (!entries) {
    return [];
  }
  const names: string[] = [];
  for (const entry of entries) {
    names.push(entry.name ?? '?');
  }
  return names;
}

/** Pulls the tool list out of the MCP server's response text. */
function parseToolsList(text: string): Array<{ name: string }> {
  const match = text.match(/\{[\s\S]*\}/);
  if (!match) {
    return [];
  }
  const parsed = JSON.parse(match[0]);
  return parsed.result?.tools ?? [];
}

async function main() {
  console.log('Checking your setup...\n');

  // ── 1. Can we reach the MCP server? ──────────────────────────────────────
  try {
    const response = await fetch(config.mcpUrl, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Accept: 'application/json, text/event-stream' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ jsonrpc: '2.0', id: 1, method: 'tools/list', params: {} }),
    });
    const text = await response.text();
    const tools = parseToolsList(text);
    console.log(`MCP server:  OK - ${tools.length} tools at ${config.mcpUrl}`);
    for (const tool of tools) console.log(`               ${tool.name}`);
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    console.log(`MCP server:  FAILED - cannot reach ${config.mcpUrl}`);
    console.log(`               ${errorMessage(error)}`);
    console.log('               Is the MCP server running? cd ../armoriq-adk-ops-mcp && npm start');
  }
  console.log();

  // ── 2. Is the ArmorIQ key valid, and do the names match? ─────────────────
  const client = new ArmorIQClient({
    apiKey: config.armoriqApiKey,
    userId: 'agent',
    agentId: config.agentName,
    useProduction: true,
  });

  try {
    const account = await client.bootstrap();
    const agentNames = namesOf(account.agents);
    const mcpNames = namesOf(account.mcps);

    console.log(`ArmorIQ:     OK - org "${account.org?.name ?? 'unknown'}"`);
    console.log(`Agents:      ${agentNames.length ? agentNames.join(', ') : 'none registered'}`);
    console.log(`MCPs:        ${mcpNames.length ? mcpNames.join(', ') : 'none registered'}`);
    console.log();

    // The two mismatches that cause "my policies aren't firing".
    if (agentNames.includes(config.agentName)) {
      console.log(`Agent name:  OK - "${config.agentName}" is registered`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Agent name:  MISMATCH - .env says "${config.agentName}", which is not registered.`);
      console.log('               Register it, or change ARMORIQ_AGENT_NAME to one of the above.');
    }

    if (mcpNames.includes(config.mcpName)) {
      console.log(`MCP name:    OK - "${config.mcpName}" is registered`);
    } else {
      console.log(`MCP name:    MISMATCH - .env says "${config.mcpName}", which is not registered.`);
      console.log('               Register it, or change ARMORIQ_MCP_NAME to one of the above.');
    }
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    console.log(`ArmorIQ:     FAILED - ${errorMessage(error)}`);
    console.log('               Check ARMORIQ_API_KEY in .env.');
  }

  console.log();
  client.close();
}

main().catch((error: unknown) => {
  console.error(errorMessage(error));
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run check
```

Get every line saying `OK` before continuing.
